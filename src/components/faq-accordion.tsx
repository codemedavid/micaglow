      {
        question: 'What is the typical dosing schedule for BPC-157 in tissue repair studies?',
        answer: 'For BPC-157 (5MG), mix with 2mL BAC water and dose 250-500mcg (25-50 units) daily subcutaneously.',
      },
      {
        question: 'How often should Retatrutide be administered?',
        answer: 'Retatrutide (6MG) should be mixed with 1.2mL BAC water and dosed weekly subcutaneously, titrating from 20 units (1mg) over 4 weeks up to 120 units (6mg).',

    questions: [
      {
        question: 'Can I stack Semaglutide with other peptides?',
        answer: 'Yes, it can be stacked with Tirzepatide for enhanced weight loss, Cagrilintide for satiety, AOD-9604 for lipolysis, or BPC-157 to mitigate GI side effects.',
      },
      {
        question: 'What peptides pair well with BPC-157 for repair?',
        answer: 'BPC-157 stacks well with TB-500 for comprehensive healing and GHK-Cu for skin and connective tissue support.',
      },
      {
        question: 'Is stacking Ipamorelin and CJC-1295 effective?',
        answer: 'Yes, combining Ipamorelin with CJC-1295 (NO dac or With dac) provides synergistic growth hormone release.',
