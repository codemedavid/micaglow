# ✅ Peptide Database Upgrade - Implementation Checklist

Use this checklist to ensure everything is properly installed and working.

## Pre-Installation

- [ ] Backup your Supabase database
- [ ] Review `PEPTIDE_UPGRADE_SUMMARY.md` for overview
- [ ] Read `INSTALLATION_STEPS.md` for detailed steps

## Installation

### Dependencies
- [ ] Run `npm install @radix-ui/react-tabs`
- [ ] Verify installation: Check `package.json` for `@radix-ui/react-tabs`

### Database Migration
- [ ] Open Supabase Dashboard
- [ ] Navigate to SQL Editor
- [ ] Copy contents of `migrate-peptides-comprehensive.sql`
- [ ] Run the migration query
- [ ] Verify: Check Table Editor → `peptides` → Should see new columns

### Data Loading
- [ ] In Supabase SQL Editor
- [ ] Copy contents of `comprehensive-peptides-data.sql`
- [ ] Run the query (may take 1-2 minutes)
- [ ] Verify: `SELECT COUNT(*) FROM peptides WHERE description IS NOT NULL;`
- [ ] Should return 70+

## File Verification

### Created Files
- [ ] `migrate-peptides-comprehensive.sql` exists
- [ ] `comprehensive-peptides-data.sql` exists
- [ ] `src/components/peptide-detail-dialog.tsx` exists
- [ ] `src/components/ui/tabs.tsx` exists
- [ ] `PEPTIDE_DATABASE_UPGRADE_GUIDE.md` exists
- [ ] `INSTALLATION_STEPS.md` exists
- [ ] `PEPTIDE_UPGRADE_SUMMARY.md` exists
- [ ] `CHECKLIST.md` exists (this file)

### Modified Files
- [ ] `src/types/database.ts` - Has new peptide fields
- [ ] `src/components/peptide-card.tsx` - Has import for PeptideDetailDialog
- [ ] `src/components/peptide-card.tsx` - Has "Details" button

## Database Verification

Run these queries in Supabase SQL Editor:

### Check New Columns
```sql
SELECT column_name, data_type 
FROM information_schema.columns 
WHERE table_name = 'peptides'
ORDER BY ordinal_position;
```
- [ ] Should see: description, mechanism, half_life, storage, benefits, etc.

### Check Data Loading
```sql
SELECT 
  COUNT(*) as total,
  COUNT(description) as has_description,
  COUNT(mechanism) as has_mechanism,
  COUNT(benefits) as has_benefits,
  COUNT(dosing) as has_dosing
FROM peptides;
```
- [ ] total should be 70+
- [ ] has_description should be 70+
- [ ] has_benefits should be 70+

### Check Categories
```sql
SELECT category, COUNT(*) 
FROM peptides 
WHERE is_active = true 
GROUP BY category 
ORDER BY count DESC;
```
- [ ] Should see multiple categories (Weight Loss, Healing, etc.)

## Application Testing

### Development Server
- [ ] Run `npm run dev`
- [ ] No errors in console
- [ ] Application starts successfully

### UI Testing

#### Peptide Cards
- [ ] Navigate to `/batches`
- [ ] Select any batch
- [ ] Peptide cards display correctly
- [ ] "Details" button visible on cards (if peptide has description)
- [ ] "Details" button styled correctly

#### Detail Dialog
- [ ] Click "Details" button
- [ ] Dialog opens smoothly
- [ ] All tabs visible: Overview, Dosing, Safety, Stacking
- [ ] Click Overview tab:
  - [ ] Description displays
  - [ ] Mechanism displays
  - [ ] Half-life shows
  - [ ] Storage info shows
  - [ ] Benefits list displays
- [ ] Click Dosing tab:
  - [ ] Dosing protocols display
  - [ ] Reconstitution info shows
  - [ ] Frequency info shows
  - [ ] Dosing guide shows
  - [ ] Storage reminder at bottom
- [ ] Click Safety tab:
  - [ ] Side effects list displays
  - [ ] Contraindications list displays
  - [ ] Disclaimer shows at bottom
- [ ] Click Stacking tab:
  - [ ] Stacking recommendations display
  - [ ] Note about stacking shows

#### Mobile Testing
- [ ] Open in mobile view (or use DevTools responsive mode)
- [ ] Peptide cards responsive
- [ ] Dialog responsive
- [ ] Tabs scrollable/usable on mobile
- [ ] All text readable

### Functionality Testing
- [ ] Can add peptides to cart (existing functionality)
- [ ] Can view multiple peptide details
- [ ] Can switch between tabs smoothly
- [ ] Can close dialog
- [ ] Can open multiple dialogs sequentially

## Code Quality

### Linting
- [ ] Run `npm run lint`
- [ ] No errors in these files:
  - [ ] `src/components/peptide-detail-dialog.tsx`
  - [ ] `src/components/peptide-card.tsx`
  - [ ] `src/components/ui/tabs.tsx`
  - [ ] `src/types/database.ts`

### TypeScript
- [ ] No TypeScript errors
- [ ] IntelliSense works for new peptide fields
- [ ] No `any` types used

## Performance

- [ ] Dialog opens quickly (< 200ms)
- [ ] Tabs switch quickly
- [ ] No layout shifts
- [ ] Images load properly (if any)
- [ ] Smooth animations

## Browser Testing

Test in multiple browsers:
- [ ] Chrome/Edge
- [ ] Firefox
- [ ] Safari (if on Mac)
- [ ] Mobile browsers

## Final Verification

### Sample Peptides to Test
Test these specific peptides for comprehensive data:

1. **Semaglutide**
   - [ ] Has description
   - [ ] Has mechanism
   - [ ] Has multiple dosing protocols
   - [ ] Has benefits list
   - [ ] Has side effects
   - [ ] Has contraindications
   - [ ] Has stacking info

2. **Tirzepatide**
   - [ ] Has comprehensive data
