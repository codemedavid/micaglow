### Typography

- Proper padding on all interactive elements
- Responsive grid layouts (1/2/3 columns)
- Better use of card layouts vs tables

## Mobile Optimizations

### Responsive Features

2. **Touch-Friendly**: Larger buttons and tap targets (h-10, h-11, h-12)
3. **Adaptive Navigation**: Text abbreviates on small screens
4. **Flexible Grids**: 1 column on mobile, 2 on tablet, 3 on desktop
5. **Hidden Elements**: Less critical info hidden on mobile (md:block)
6. **Proper Truncation**: Text truncates instead of wrapping awkwardly
7. **Responsive Typography**: text-xl md:text-2xl patterns throughout

### Touch Interactions
- Larger quantity selector buttons (h-10 w-10)
- Prominent "Add to Cart" buttons (h-11)
- Adequate spacing between interactive elements
- No hover-only interactions (all info visible by default)
