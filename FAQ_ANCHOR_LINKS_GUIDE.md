# FAQ Anchor Links Guide

## Overview
Each FAQ item now has a unique anchor link that allows you to send direct links to specific questions. When someone clicks the link, the page will:
1. âœ… Auto-scroll to the FAQ
2. âœ… Auto-expand the answer
3. âœ… Highlight the FAQ for 3 seconds with a colored ring

## How to Get a Link to a Specific FAQ

### Method 1: Hover & Copy (Recommended)
1. Go to the FAQ page
2. Hover over any FAQ question
3. Click the **link icon** that appears on the right side
4. The link is automatically copied to your clipboard
5. You'll see a "Copied!" confirmation

### Method 2: Manual Construction
The URL format is:
```
https://yourdomain.com/faq#[slug-of-question]
```

The slug is created by:
- Converting the question to lowercase
- Replacing spaces and special characters with hyphens
- Removing consecutive hyphens
