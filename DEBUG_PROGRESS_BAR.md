## 🧪 **TESTING STEPS - DO THIS NOW**

### Step 1: Visit Test Page
```
http://localhost:3000/test-progress
```

You should see a page with:
- Big heading "Progress Bar Test Page"
- Several navigation buttons
- Debug info box (top right)
- Debug controls box (bottom right)

### Step 2: Open Browser Console
```
Press F12
Go to Console tab
```

You should see debug messages like:
```
=== PROGRESS BAR DEBUG ===
Window loaded: true
NProgress loaded: true/false
```

### Step 3: Test Manual Trigger
Click the button **"Test Progress Bar Manually"** in the bottom right corner.

**What should happen:**
- You should see a **purple bar** appear at the **very top** of the page
- It should animate from 0% → 40% → 70% → 100%
- Then fade out

**If you see the bar:**
✅ NProgress is working! The issue is with route transitions.

**If you DON'T see the bar:**
❌ NProgress isn't loading properly.

### Step 4: Test Navigation
Click any of the navigation buttons:
- "Navigate to Home"
- "Navigate to Batches"
- "Navigate to Orders"

**What should happen:**
- Purple bar appears at top
- Animates during navigation
- Completes when page loads

## 🔍 Common Issues & Fixes

### Issue 1: "NProgress loaded: false"
**Fix:** Package not loading
```bash
# Reinstall packages
npm install nprogress next-nprogress-bar --force
# Restart dev server
npm run dev
```

### Issue 2: Manual test works, but navigation doesn't
**Fix:** Route transition not triggering
- This means NProgress works, but the App Router integration has issues
- May need a different approach

### Issue 3: Console shows errors
**Fix:** Depends on the error - please share it!

### Issue 4: Nothing happens at all
**Fix:** Check if CSS is loaded
```
F12 → Elements → Search for "nprogress"
Should find CSS rules
```

## 💡 Alternative Solution

If this still doesn't work, we can try a **simpler alternative** using just `nprogress` directly without the Next.js wrapper. But let's see the debug results first!
