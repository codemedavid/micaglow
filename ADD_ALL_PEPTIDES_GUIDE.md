# Add All Peptides Feature

## ✨ New Feature: Bulk Add Peptides to Batch

You can now add **all available peptides** to a batch at once with the same default settings!

## 🚀 How to Use

### From Batch Editor Page

1. Go to **Admin** → **Batches** → Click on a batch (or create a new one)

2. You'll see two buttons:
   - **"Add All Peptides (X)"** - Adds all available peptides
   - **"Add Single Peptide"** - Adds one peptide at a time

3. Click **"Add All Peptides (X)"** where X is the count of available peptides

4. In the dialog, set default values:
   - **Vials per Box**: e.g., 10
   - **Boxes Available**: e.g., 5
   - **Price per Vial**: e.g., ₱950

5. Review the preview:
   - Total vials per peptide
   - Price per vial
   - Total peptides to add

6. Click **"Add All Peptides"**

7. The system will add all peptides sequentially with your default values

## 💡 When to Use

**Use "Add All Peptides" when:**
- ✅ Starting a new batch with standard pricing
- ✅ All peptides have similar pricing structure
- ✅ You want to quickly set up a batch
- ✅ Same box sizes across all peptides

**Use "Add Single Peptide" when:**
- ✅ Different pricing for each peptide
- ✅ Different box sizes
- ✅ Adding specific peptides only
- ✅ Fine-tuning individual settings

## 📋 Example Workflow

### Quick Batch Setup

```bash
1. Admin → Create New Batch
   Name: "November 2024 Group Buy"
   Status: DRAFT
   
2. Click "Add All Peptides (10)"
   Vials per Box: 10
   Boxes Available: 5
   Price per Vial: 950
   
3. Click "Add All Peptides"
   → All 10 peptides added instantly! ✅
   
4. Change status to "OPEN" or "FILLING"
   → Batch is now live for customers! 🎉
```

## 🎯 Features

**Smart Filtering:**
- Only shows peptides not yet in the batch
- Button disabled if all peptides already added
- Shows count of available peptides

**Preview Before Adding:**
- See total vials calculation
- See price formatting
- See count of peptides to add

**Progress Indicator:**
- Button shows "Adding... (X)" while processing
- Disabled during operation
- Auto-closes dialog on success

**Error Handling:**
- Stops on first error
- Shows error message via toast
- Doesn't corrupt your batch on failure

## ⚙️ Technical Details

**How It Works:**
1. Fetches all peptides from database
2. Filters out peptides already in batch
3. Shows count of available peptides
4. On submit, adds peptides sequentially
5. Uses same default values for all
6. Invalidates cache to refresh UI
7. Shows toast notification

**Performance:**
- Adds peptides one by one (safer)
- Shows progress in button text
- Prevents duplicate additions
- Validates all inputs before starting

## 🎨 UI/UX

**Button States:**
- Enabled: "Add All Peptides (X)" - Shows count
- Disabled: Grayed out when no peptides available
- Loading: "Adding... (X)" - Shows progress

**Dialog:**
- Purple-themed consistent with app
- Clear preview of what will be added
- Easy to cancel anytime
- Shows helpful descriptions

## 📊 Use Cases

### Scenario 1: Standard Group Buy
```
All peptides: ₱950/vial, 10 vials/box, 5 boxes
→ Use "Add All Peptides" with these defaults
```

### Scenario 2: Mixed Pricing
```
BPC-157: ₱950/vial
TB-500: ₱1,200/vial
CJC-1295: ₱850/vial
→ Use "Add Single Peptide" for each
```

### Scenario 3: Partial Batch
```
Add 5 specific peptides first with "Add Single"
Later add remaining with "Add All Peptides"
→ System only adds the ones not yet in batch
```

## ✅ Benefits

1. **Save Time**: Add 10-20 peptides in seconds
2. **Consistency**: Same values across all peptides
3. **Efficiency**: Fewer clicks, less typing
4. **Safety**: Preview before adding
5. **Flexibility**: Can still add individually

## 🎉 Result

After adding all peptides:
- ✅ All peptides show in batch table
- ✅ Each with correct pricing and quantities
- ✅ Fill progress shows 0/total for each
- ✅ Ready for customers to order
- ✅ Can still edit individual peptides later

**Enjoy the bulk add feature! Makes batch setup super fast! 🚀💜**
