# ⭐ Featured Batch - Quick Setup

## ✅ What's New

**Customers now see ONLY ONE featured batch** on the main page!

## 🚀 Quick Setup (3 Steps)

### Step 1: Run SQL Migration

**Copy and paste this in Supabase SQL Editor:**

```sql
-- Add featured batch column
ALTER TABLE batches 
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS is_featured boolean DEFAULT false;

-- Add index for performance
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_batches_featured 
ON batches(is_featured) WHERE is_featured = true;

-- Function to atomically switch featured batch
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION set_featured_batch(batch_id_param uuid)
RETURNS void AS $$
BEGIN
  -- Unfeature all batches
  UPDATE batches SET is_featured = false WHERE is_featured = true;
  -- Feature the selected one
  UPDATE batches SET is_featured = true WHERE id = batch_id_param;
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;
```

Click "Run" ✅

### Step 2: Set Your Featured Batch

**Option A: Via Admin UI (Recommended)**
```bash
1. Go to /admin/batches
2. Find your current active batch
3. Click "Set Featured" button
4. Confirm
5. Done! ⭐
```

**Option B: Via SQL (Quick)**
```sql
-- Get your batch IDs first
SELECT id, name, status FROM batches ORDER BY created_at DESC;

-- Set your batch as featured (replace the ID)
SELECT set_featured_batch('paste-batch-id-here');
```

### Step 3: Verify

**Check Customer View:**
```bash
1. Go to /batches
2. Should see ONLY your featured batch
3. Large, centered display
4. "⭐ Current Featured Batch" badge
5. Perfect! ✅
```

## 🎯 How to Use

### Switching Featured Batches

When you want to feature a different batch:

```bash
Admin → Batches → Click "Set Featured" on new batch

What happens:
✅ Old featured batch → unfeatured automatically
✅ New batch → featured
✅ Customer page updates immediately
✅ Shows new batch only
```

### Typical Workflow

**During a Month:**
```bash
Week 1: Create "November 2024" batch, set featured
        Customers see November batch only

Week 2-3: Orders come in, batch fills

Week 4: November fills, goes to PAYMENT
        Create "December 2024" batch
        Set December as featured ⭐
        Customers now see December only
```
