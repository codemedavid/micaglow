# Dosing Guide - Public Access Configuration

## ✅ Public Access Enabled

The dosing guide at `/dosing-guide` is now **publicly accessible** to everyone, including non-authenticated users.

---

## 🔓 What Was Changed

### Middleware Update
**File**: `src/middleware.ts`

Added `/dosing-guide` to the public routes array:

```typescript
// Before
const publicRoutes = ['/', '/auth/join', '/auth/login']

// After
const publicRoutes = ['/', '/auth/join', '/auth/login', '/dosing-guide']
```

## 🔒 Security Considerations

### Safe to Make Public:
✅ Peptide names and descriptions  
✅ Dosing protocols and guidelines  
✅ Safety information and warnings  
✅ Benefits and mechanisms of action  
✅ Stacking recommendations  

### Why It's Safe:
- No pricing information shown (that's in batches)
- No user data exposed
- No order information visible
- No batch availability shown
- No vendor pricing revealed
- Read-only access only

### Still Protected:
🔒 User profiles  
🔒 Order information  
🔒 Cart contents  
🔒 Batch pricing  
🔒 Batch availability  
🔒 Admin functions

## 📊 Data Access

### What the Dosing Guide Reads:
```sql
SELECT * FROM peptides 
WHERE is_active = true
ORDER BY category, name
```

### Database Permissions:
- **Public read access** to `peptides` table (standard Supabase setup)
- No authentication required for reading peptide information
- All write operations still require authentication

---

## 🧪 Testing

### Test as Non-Authenticated User:
1. ✅ Open incognito/private browser window
2. ✅ Visit your site homepage
3. ✅ Click "Dosing Guide" link
4. ✅ Should load without redirect to login
5. ✅ Search for a peptide
6. ✅ Filter by category
7. ✅ Click "View Full Details"

## 🎨 UI Implications

The dosing guide page is already designed to work without authentication:
- No user-specific content displayed
- No cart buttons or "Add to Batch" CTAs
- Pure informational content
- Self-contained functionality

### Call-to-Action Flow:
```
Dosing Guide (Public)
      ↓
"Ready to Join a Batch?" CTA
      ↓
View Active Batches button
      ↓
Login Required (if not authenticated)
```

## 🔧 Technical Details

### Middleware Logic:
```typescript
// Check if route is public
const isPublicRoute = publicRoutes.some(route => 
  route === '/' 
    ? request.nextUrl.pathname === '/' 
    : request.nextUrl.pathname.startsWith(route)
)

// Redirect to login if not public and not authenticated
if (!user && !isPublicRoute) {
  return NextResponse.redirect('/auth/login')
}
```

### Route Matching:
- `/dosing-guide` → ✅ Public
- `/dosing-guide/anything` → ✅ Public (startsWith matching)
- `/batches` → 🔒 Protected
- `/cart` → 🔒 Protected

### Potential Additions to Public Access:
- [ ] `/about` page
- [ ] `/faq` page
